## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

I Want to keep the background color of the menu to stay (color) active when clicked. Any suggestions, tips or help?
